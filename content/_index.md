Dogfooding and self-hosting of my own website.  The aim is to have this hosted on an Arm platform, with a Yocto based distro, served from a container.

Progress to date, and current TODO list:

* [x] Create a static website based on markdown
* [x] Add simple responsive theme
* [ ] Build a hosting machine
* [ ] Serve the content

Resources on this site include

* My personal [blog](/blog)
* Information on [boards](/boards) that I have been using
